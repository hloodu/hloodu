## Hi! I'm Harman Loodu.

I'm an undergraduate student currently completing a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics (Honours, co-op) at the University of Waterloo. 
I'm interested in software development, data science, and physics, and I'm experienced with Python, Processing, and DrRacket. I'm also an all-round creative person -- other passions of mine include music, painting, writing, and crocheting! 

I'm looking for a co-op position that will leverage and expand on the strong problem-solving, creative thinking, and analytical skills I've gained through my math, computer science, and physics coursework. 

Feel free to contact me through the links in the sidebar!
