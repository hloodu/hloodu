## Hi! I'm Harman Loodu.

I'm an undergraduate student currently completing a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics (Honours, co-op) at the University of Waterloo.
I have hands-on experience with multiple programming languages, such as Python, Processing, and DrRacket, and am interested in data science, software development, and statistics.
I'm also a talented writer, and a creative person -- other passions of mine include music, painting, and crocheting.
I'm looking for co-op oppurtunities for Spring 2025 (May-August), where I can make use of and improve my problem solving and creative skills!

Feel free to follow, email, or connect with me using the links at the left sidebar!
